                    <p>Don't take rest after your first victory because if you fail in the second, 
                        more lips are waiting to say that your first victory was just luck.</p>

                    <p>My message, especially to young people is to have courage to think differently, 
                        courage to invent, to travel the unexplored path, courage to discover the impossible and 
                        to conquer the problems and succeed. These are great qualities that they must work towards.</p>
